Phew, we made it!

There is a python file called whereami.py. Run it with the command python whereami.py

Figure out how to make the file happy! Here are some helpful commands:
- You can make a new directory with the command mkdir [dir_name]
- You can move a file with the command mv [file] [destination]
- You can copy a file with the command cp [file] [destination]
