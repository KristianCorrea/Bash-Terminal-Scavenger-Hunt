The command grep finds instances of words in a file, with syntax grep [word]

First, print out the file sentences (using the cat command).

Then, print out only the lines that contain the word computer (remember the pipe syntax!).

And finally, count them by piping *that* output into the wc command like you've already done. You can string together multiple pipes!

Enter the directory with that same number as its name!
