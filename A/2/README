Count the number of lines in the file howmanylines. No, not by hand! Using Unix commands!

First, print out the contents of the file with the cat command.

Normally, that output gets sent to the terminal where you can read it. But you can send it somewhere else with the pipe (|) symbol.

The wc command counts the number of lines in some text. Try sending the output of the cat command to the wc command like this:
cat howmanylines | wc

We got 3 numbers! How do we know which one we want? Check the man page of the wc command!

Go into the directory with the name equal to the number of lines in the file.
